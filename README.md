# Basic cpp course comprised of three parts:
/pythongame - snake ascii game 
- madpython.cpp 

/pt1 - basic tasks, ascii tic tac toe game
- ttt           - main executable
- tictac.cpp    - class structure for ttt
- taskseven.cpp - namespaces, directives
-  tasksix.cpp - file io / memory
-  taskfive.cpp - functions
-  taskfour.cpp - cycle/ conditions
-  taskthree - externals, libraries, arrays, pointers
-  secondtask.cpp - enum, union, structs

/pt2 - OOP tasks, plus Black Jack 

/pt3 - 
- t1.cpp , extra types, lambda functions

## for snake game
0.1- basic gameplay, collisions, tail extension
 
### TODO LIST:
* sticky key problem, due to ncurses processing cursor keys as three presses at once, including escape
* inadequate collisions, due to coordinate space calculated through float.
* delay based update cycle, not considering computer speed
* lacks OOP classes, no strict divide between graphical and data processing
* lacks collision with tail and fruit respawn.
